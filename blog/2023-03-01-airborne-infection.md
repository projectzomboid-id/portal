The virus wasn’t supposed to be airborne. The intention was to use it to clear up a single city, no one thought that it could spread this wide, this fast. Didn’t take long before the whole county needed to be shut off and locked down.

The military higher up promises that they got the situation under control, that the citizens don’t need to worry about anything, no one knows that they’re actually the one behind the virus. Yes, the general ordered the virus to be made.

The group of scientists he hired assure him that it will be a harmless biological weapon, clearing up a small city would be as easy as flipping the back of your hand. No one told him that one of the scientists is the daughter of someone from his past, someone whose death is caused by his ambition. Not only did she manage to sabotage the whole production, she also leaked his official order of the virus to the resistance group. Military integrity is at risk.

The world is in shambles, yet the military focus is never toward the ending of the plague. The remaining survivors can only rely on themselves. There’s no more safeplace in this world, our best option is to hold hands together as we rebuild the new world. We’ll make it through.

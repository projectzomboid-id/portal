Season 12 is the season with the longest life we've been through so far. Even in this season there are lots of interesting things that we, as a management team, finally can develop. Starting from a shift in currency which initially used IPZ Coin, to become the Rupiah currency, until electronic systems emerged such as ATM machines, money deposits and transfers between players which were very easy to operate. Then, the existence of the smuggler finally raised the ultimate goal for players to play until the season ends. This smuggler feature is a new thing that will eventually become one of the main feature in our server so that it can increase player enthusiasm in playing to achieve their final goal.

Apart from that, Season 12 also provides a lot of experience regarding server capacity and technical matters related to server performance more broadly. We realize that the size of the save file and the changes that occur in the world greatly affect the ability of players to be able to enter the server. Besides, the number of vehicles, items on the floor and the use of mods are also things that also took a lot of server resources. Even though we are currently using a better spec than before, blackchunk and performance problems still cannot be completely avoided.

Learning from everything that happened in Season 12, in the end our team management needs to decide many things to minimize problems and also improve the good things at Season 13. For that, there are several important adjustments and new things that everyone need to know, which is:

**1. Rules regarding the use and storing cars.** We need and must do this in order to reduce car hoarding and car parking in one place simultaneously. As we explained earlier, the presence of cars and the number of cars in one place greatly affect the rendering power of the client and server. We all knew that incidents of "marrying" cars often occur due to the time-consuming rendering time on the client machine. We hope that you guys can understand this decision and follow these rules carefully.

**2. Market prices will always change according to server economic conditions.** As you know, some of the selling prices that we have set at Commerce Station have actually caused inflation on the server economy as a whole in Season 12. It happened because there are items that were easy to get that have a quite high selling prices, one of it was an item from trapping results. Understanding this situation, we made the decision to always make changes to the selling price within a certain period of time so that the server economy can always be stable and under control.

**3. Community Center location change** A few weeks ago, we were trying to complete the Community Center map mod that we hope would continue to work season after season. Currently we are trying to provide everything that is needed by the server, especially in providing space for players to gather, interact and transact.

**4. Added and removed mods.** Knowing there was a server problem at last season, we tried to be more careful at choosing mods. Starting from mods that have better scripting, mods that are more reliable, and mods that are more up to date than some of the mods we've used in previous seasons. This also includes the use of mod map which we eventually regenerated to provide a new experience for players, a more complete melee pack mod than last season, as well as several QoL mods which may have a small impact but are sufficient to provide benefits and convenience for players. Brita armor pack had a very huge update aswell that can provide new cool items for everyone to wear.

**5. Added exclusive items for donors and the presence of Token currency.** In this season, we are trying to objectify the ideas that have been stored for a long time and have not been implemented since the previous seasons, namely rewards for donators. So far, we have had difficulty determining items that are worth selling to donators because we really avoid "Pay to Win" will happen on this server. However, we finally found a bright spot to finally be able to make the idea a reality. Tokens will be the currency that donators can earn and can be used to purchase exclusive items that will be sold at the Commerce Station. Yet, this system is still under development and we can't promise that it will be there since the new season starts. But, we will try our best so that this system can be implemented quickly and is good for everyone to enjoy.

**6. Not using the modpack anymore.** We realize that using modpacks often presents problems such as client files that don't match the server or files that aren't properly installed on the client side. The most important thing is, we also want to appreciate the modders who have taken their time to build their mod from scratch by subscribing directly as a form of support for them. However, it should be understood that not using a modpack means there will be a possibility of a server restart outside of the daily restart due to mod updates which are beyond our control. For this reason, we hope that everyone can be cooperative and helpful by providing information regarding "Workshop item different than the server" to the admin so that we can follow up as soon as possible.

**7. Indonesia Project Zomboid will officially become a PVE Server.** Yup, we understand the culture that we have built and we really care about, namely kinship. Looking at the behavior of the players as a whole, we also feel that this choice is the best choice for everyone. For this reason, by making the Indonesia Project Zomboid a PVE Server, it can be interpreted that IPZ will remove the entire KOS zone from the server aswell.

Those are things that we think very important for you to know. Hopefully this decision is the best decision for all of us and for the continuation of the Indonesia Project Zomboid server in the future, especially in Season 13.

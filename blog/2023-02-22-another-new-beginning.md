Amazing that we’ve been enjoying Season 13 for almost 2 months now, and like what you’ve been experiencing this season is the most packed in IPZ history– proven by us achieving the #1 rank in Battlemetrics and a stable base of ~80 players almost every night, even sometimes jam packed with 100 players which caused the server to be overloaded sometimes.

But no worries, you’re allowed to be sad, as we all know everything will be returned to the beginning at the right time. All our progress that we’ve made so far will be encapsulated and remembered as one of the best season that we’ve built together. Long story short, we’ll be doing Season Wipe around February 28st, 2023 at 23:59 GMT+7.

For those of you that don’t understand what Season Wipe, it is a process of deleting save games and characters which results in the entire game process going back to the beginning, this includes all the pretty safehouse you’ve built, vehicles you own, and character you’ve been using, everything will be reseted to the very beginning.

Here are a few concepts we might implement in Season 14:

 1. Switching modded map
 2. Upgrade on DAMRI feature to make it more interesting
 3. Antique Weapon and Wearable adjustment
 4. Economy balancing
 5. Cure and Vaccine making balancing
 6. Changing discord verification system
 7. Server whitelist implementation

At the end of Season 13, we will showcase the summary of this season in which we can see all the achievements that we’ve reached these last 2 months.
See you next season!

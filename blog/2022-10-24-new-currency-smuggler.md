As you heard in the previous announcement that we will be making an overhaul to the current currency system which is due to the arrival of Smuggler in Season 12.

There are several drawbacks to our current currency (IPZ Coin & IPZ Coin Pouch) where there is a limited amount of money that can be carried at one time due to the weight of the item.

Items that will be sold by Smuggler will be difficult to buy because of the difficulty of carrying Coin Pouch in large quantities, therefore we changed the Coin system to Banknotes named "**Rupiah**" (_Weight: 0.01, Equal to 1 Coin_), and can be combined into **Stack of Rupiah** (_Weight: 0.75, Equal to 100 Rupiah / 100 Coin_), then the item with the highest value is **Check of Rupiah** (_Weight 0.2, Equal to 10,000 Rupiah / 100 Coin Pouch / 10,000 Coin_). So far we have completed the Currency feature and will test it as soon as possible.

We also modified the **Briefcase**, where you can put large amounts of money into it, and making it easier for you to carry your possessions to transaction, and _show off_ ![:KEKW:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/984398195994021889.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) .
After the new currency is applied, we will give all players time to convert Coin and Coin Pouch to Rupiah by right clicking on Coin or Coin Pouch, then "Convert to Rupiah".

And also we are currently working on a new server that has a larger capacity and is more stable, we will explain in more detail another time.

Anddddddddd, thank you! ![:pepecool:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1032334186750689341.webp?size=44&quality=lossless)

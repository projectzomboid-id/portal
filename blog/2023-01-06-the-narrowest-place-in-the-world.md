_**I wish the blog title was just a joke, but sadly it's a fact**._

We've been enjoying Season 13 for 1 week and 2 days, and as you know slot players are really too crowded, even the Admin has trouble getting in because it's always full. The funny thing is that now half of our Project Zomboid playtime is spent only for pressing the refresh button every 5 seconds.

And as you would expect, we have now reached out to our beloved server provider to upgrade to the best they can offer. To be honest, the price is not cheap, but we really understand that your happiness while playing in Indonesia Project Zomboid is more valuable _trying to be romantic_. We really hope that this dedicated server is able to bring us through Season 13 in an enjoyable way, considering there will be many upcoming events and cool things that we have been planning for a long time.

Let's leave the discussion about servers aside. By the way, Congratulations! This week we have successfully achieved Rank #2 in Battlemetrics. An achievement we didn't expect after so many rollbacks, crashes, queues, and other crazy things. Thank you to all of you!

Lastly, We will release Exclusive items as soon as possible. Yep! As a donator, you will later receive a special currency called "_Token_", which allows you to purchase exclusive cosmetic items at the Commerce Station. These tokens are obtained from the donation you made to the server starting from the start of Season 13. But we will explain the rest in the guide when the system is implemented.

_**P.s. The token cannot be used for your home's electricity, it's Indonesian jokes btw, you can ignore it :3**_

That's it for this blog! _We hope that donations will run smoothly in the future so that we can enjoy the new server in peace~_

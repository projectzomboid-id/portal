It's been five years since the Zombie King attacked the remaining survivors in Knox Country. The survivors' victory knocked out the Zombie King and sent him back to where he came from. However, the departure of this creature left a big impact on the world, and Knox Country was no exception.

It's been five years since the Zombie King attacked the remaining survivors in Knox Country. The survivors' victory knocked out the Zombie King and sent him back to where he came from. However, the departure of this creature left a big impact on the world, and Knox Country was no exception.

The living conditions in Knox Country were becoming more and more difficult. The supplies for survival would reach a point where there was nothing left. The electricity is no longer running and the water is getting dry. Weapons will be rare and fresh food has not been around for the past 2 years. The survivors can only rely on dry food or private plantations accompanied by favorable weather to finally get their daily special food. The walls of the buildings look brittle and various plants creep on every structure of the city. Many big cities eventually died uninhabited, even razed to the ground, such as Over The River. Being smart is necessary at a time like this because if not, the only choice left is death.

But on the other hand, several other cities and countries are finally trying to open up. Most of the survivors from elsewhere ended up looking for ways to make better connections with the sanctuary from all over the city. In conditions like this, fighting together and uniting to survive is the right choice. Several cities that initially closed their access finally reconnected in Knox Country. And, this presents a new system that can benefit survivors from all over the country.

The system of buying and selling and exchanging are now getting better and survivors can complement each other. The Community Center that was previously only used by a part of Knox Country, has finally become a comprehensive meeting point, where it is finally able to connect all new cities. The Community Center is a place where everyone tries to exchange everything they have for something they desperately need to survive. However, since the other cities appeared, they brought a number of items that were quite surprising to the survivors. It never occurred to the survivors that out there, there is still great hope for survival, as if a normal life can be achieved with the palm of the hand.

A new civilization has finally begun, with something different and also new challenges. Ease comes at the right time now, but difficulties also come at the same time. Can the survivors of Knox Country make it through?

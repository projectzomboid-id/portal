Season 12 has finally ended! Our plan to make the server run for more than 1 month turned out to be realized as well. This season, we have implemented several new systems and mechanisms in the game which have been successful in making player's gameplay last up to 2 months. In addition, we have finally developed a mod that can give access to a wider database! For this reason, on this occasion we will provide a summary of our journey in Season 12.

Thank you for the moments of togetherness and fun in the past 2 months! We hope that server performance will continue to improve in the next season, so that we can bring new journeys and experiences for all of you.

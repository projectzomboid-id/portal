Wow, can't believe Season 11 is already a month old now! This is really an unexpected accomplishment for us. Since Season 8, IPZ has experienced a save game problem where it always corrupted every time the season's age hit its 3rd weeks. We concluded that the problem came from the use of multiple mods which was not completely stable and has a lot of bugs. Good news, once the problematic mod has been removed and we finally can enjoy the final phase of the game in peace, like today.


Season 11 is basically the season where we have to make a difficult decision for everyone. We have no choice than to remove half of the mods that we use at previous season to prove whether this season will be stable or not, knowing that these past 3 wipes we always stumbled upon problems. But, we also notice that this decision also made the gameplay somewhat unappealing and monotonous, which also the reason why we lose active players at this moment, made the world reached the endgame quickly. Not to mention that the problem with Build 41.73 that was affecting Linux OS also took a big part of it, require us to stay at 41.71 since May and made our server existence is undetectable compared to other server that use the latest patch.

Build 41.77 is finally out and we all have tested it! This build is very promising, specifically for Linux OS. It fix the crashes issues that we encountered at 41.73 and also gave people better connection, can be seen from the significant development of the latency of each player after implement it to the server.

Knowing the current state of the server and the release of the latest patch from Project Zomboid made us feel that wipe and opening a new season is the right decision to take in the near future. Therefore, we are now preparing the Season 12 that will be executed around this early October. But we will not wipe it without something special at our last day in Season 11. As a closing, we will be holding the last event for this season, which none other than The Zombie King! The event will need a whole community participation, and everyone who join the event will get an advantage of obtaining a starter pack at the first day of Season 12. We will announce all the details later today at ‚Å†üéäÔ∏±main-event We really hope that everyone can enliven our last event before we finally start the new beginning again.

Until now, we have finally preparing a lot of big plans to change the gameplay to something more challenging and more fun for everyone! Things will be different and a lot of mod plans is finally switched in this season, forcing everyone to get out from their comfort zone and adapting to new environment! These are some things that you need to know about the changes that might happen in Season 12:

**1. Some changes of the system**, one of them is about Teleportation. Next season we will no longer use teleporter at all. We would want to encourage everyone to travel and to move more form one place to another. Therefore, player can have more engagement with a lot of situation in the world. This hopefully will fix the problem of uneven looting experience from each players. Spawn loot chance and system will also be shifted and make it more hard to be obtained, with expectation that players interaction and transaction will happen more often than usual.

**2. Switching mod that related to traits.** We will remove More Traits and change it with SOTO (Simple Overhaul: Traits and Occupations). More Traits has been with us since day one and we thought that replacing it will give new challenge for everyone, especially veteran players gameplay. Player need to learn and to adjust with new playstyle and this will make the game experience new and fresh. But we also decided to keep the antique items for achievements and event reward purposes.

**3. New Mod Configuration.** There will be few changes of mod configuration that related to weapons, items and map. We are now more confident to add new mod map, add new melee mod to the system, putting the AuthenticZ and Sapphs cooking back to the game, and many more to expect.

We are now still working on the Season 12 so everything is right in place and balance. Before we open the new season, we will also held a new season test for everyone to taste! Hopefully at Season 12 will have a lot of new things and interesting stuff that is worth to play with!
